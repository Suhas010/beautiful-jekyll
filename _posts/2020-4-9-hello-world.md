# First blog post

Yeah, it's 9th of April 2019 and I am 25 years old.
On my 25th Birthday, I have decided to write about stuff that I consume and create and let everyone know what I'm up to.

The idea behind this is it might help/motivate someone to start creating things.
So Instead of writing on medium or any other platform, I have created my own blog with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).

I believe sharing knowledge is the only way to widen the height and width of the knowledge.
